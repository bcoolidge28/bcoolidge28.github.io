		<h1>Return Of The Crown!</h1>
		<h2>Benton Coolidge`s project website!</h2>
		<p>This project is a text based adventure game.It is an adventure game in which you must battle five different monsters to get upgrades. It gets harder after each enemy that you defeat because they progressively get stronger. You try to beat all the ememies to get the kings crown back to him for 5,000,000 gold pieces as a reward.</p>
		<p>This project was a very time consuming project. When coding the project there were many moments in which I did not know what to do. When I finally figured out my problems I was very proud. That`s why this was the most rewarding project that I have done.</p> 
		<p>Go to my <a href="https://github.com/bcoolidge28/Benton-and-Serenas-project">Github</a> repository for my project.</p>

		<p>That part gave me trouble because I put all of the fights into 1 while file so it kept confusing me because I had to get it to stop once you died but I eventually figured it out so I used it as an example for the rest of my code.</p>

		<p>That was the beginning of the game where you learn how to fight enemies which and what your reward is if you beat the game.</p>

		<p>In this part of the game you are fighting the slime ball which is the second of five enemies that you must kill to beat the game.</p>
